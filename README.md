## Requirements

* NodeJS + npm
* Bower
* Gulp

### Setting up the environment

You'll need **gulp** to compile this project and **bower** and **npm** to install the dependencies for development.

#### Installing NodeJS & NPM

If you don't already have node and npm installed, visit [the node website](http://nodejs.org/) to download and install the proper package. npm comes standard with node as a package so no need to install it separately.

#### Setting up Bower

Once you have npm, you can use it to install bower.

`npm install -g bower`

### Getting started

1. Once you have the environment set up, download the Bower components by using the command `bower install`.
2. Install the project's dependencies(including gulp) by using command `npm install`.
3. To compile, run `gulp`. This should create a folder `dist` containing the compiled project.
4. To have gulp watch your work and reload the browser, run `gulp watch`.
